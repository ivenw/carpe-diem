Quick learner and analytical mind with 9 years of experience in research and data \

personal = """In my free time I enjoy video games to relax and kick back. \
When I don't have a controller in my hand, I like to look for inspiration for things \
to cook with my partner, going on walks or bike tours. I am driven by curiosity and \
thrive on learning about something new, so I am often found scouring Wikipedia, \
Reddit, or YouTube for details on topics such as rockets, space, psychology or \
programming and computer science. I am quite handy and in the spirit of "working \
with my brain, relaxing with my hands", am not afraid to take a screwdriver into my \
own hand to fix or build something (like my own keyboards). I enjoy hosting friends \
and family, tending to them with my signature Amaretto Whisky Sour and engaging in \
a round of board- gaming."""
